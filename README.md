# ttn's elisp tutorial

This is the last available version of Thien-Thi Nguyen's Emacs Elisp tutorial. 
The [original location](http://www.gnuvola.org/software/elisp-tutorial/elisp-tutorial-2.05.tar.gz) appears to be dead. 
I found a copy in the Internet Archive, so I'm putting it here to make it easier to find. 

See [index.html](index.html) for more information on the tutorial itself.
